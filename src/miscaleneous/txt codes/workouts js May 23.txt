Please note:
- If the user's input includes any indications of injury or limitations, include potential modifications or exercise alternatives.
- Ensure that even if the user's lifestyle input is varied (for example, "busy office job", "parenting challenges", "active outdoors", etc.), the workout plan is optimized accordingly.
- For days not designated as workout days (if workoutDays is less than 7), output the following exact rest instruction:
  <strong>Rest Day:</strong> Take a 10-15 minute light walk, perform a gentle yoga sequence, foam rolling, and dynamic stretching. Briefly explain how each activity aids recovery.

Please generate a personalized workout plan that is clear, safe, and easy to follow. **Important Formatting Instructions:**
- Each section title (e.g., <strong>Warm-Up (5 minutes)</strong>, <strong>Main Circuit (2 circuits)</strong>, <strong>Rest &amp; Cool-Down</strong>, <strong>Cool-Down</strong>) must be wrapped in HTML <strong> tags.
- For every exercise in the main circuit, wrap the exercise name in <strong> tags. Immediately following the exercise instructions, add a new line with <strong>Primary muscles worked:</strong> followed by the relevant muscles.
- Also output key instructions such as <strong>Perform each exercise with proper form and focus on engaging the targeted muscles.</strong>, <strong>Take deep breaths and stretch to help your muscles recover and prevent injury.</strong>, and <strong>Focus on your breathing and relax your muscles to aid in recovery.</strong>.
- For Sunday (or any non-workout day), if applicable, output the exact rest-day instruction specified above.

For a bodyweight/home workout (Tabata-style), follow these guidelines:
1. IF the time commitment is "10-20 minutes":
   - <strong>Warm-Up (3 minutes):</strong> Provide 2-3 dynamic warm-up exercises (e.g., 30 seconds each of light cardio and dynamic stretches). Briefly explain which muscles are activated.
   - <strong>Main Circuit (1 circuit):</strong> Create 2-3 simple exercises. For each, list the exercise name (wrapped in <strong> tags), provide detailed form instructions, and on a new line include <strong>Primary muscles worked:</strong> followed by the targeted muscles. Each exercise should be performed for 30 seconds (including brief rest intervals).
   - <strong>Rest &amp; Cool-Down:</strong> Include a 1-minute active recovery (deep breathing/light stretching) and a 3-minute cool-down with 2-3 static stretches. Explain the recovery benefits and include dynamic recovery tips.
   - Advise potential modifications if the user has any physical limitations.
2. IF the time commitment is "20-30 minutes":
   - <strong>Warm-Up (4 minutes):</strong> Provide 3-4 dynamic exercises with brief explanations.
   - <strong>Main Circuit (1 circuit):</strong> Specify 3-4 exercises, each for around 40-45 seconds, with detailed instructions and on a new line include <strong>Primary muscles worked:</strong> for each.
   - <strong>Rest &amp; Cool-Down:</strong> Insert a 1-minute recovery period and a 4-minute cool-down with thorough stretching.
   - Include a motivational tip such as <strong>Stay focused—progress takes time.</strong>
3. IF the time commitment is "30-45 minutes":
   - <strong>Warm-Up (5 minutes):</strong> Include a thorough warm-up with a variety of dynamic movements and brief explanations.
   - <strong>Main Circuit (2 circuits):</strong> Each circuit should contain 3-4 exercises performed for 30-40 seconds each, with detailed instructions and after each exercise include a new line with <strong>Primary muscles worked:</strong> followed by the targeted muscles.
   - <strong>Rest &amp; Cool-Down:</strong> Include a 1-minute rest after each circuit and conclude with a 5-minute cool-down that details each stretch and dynamic recovery tips.
   - Suggest progressive adjustments for intensity or circuit number.
4. IF the time commitment is "45-60 minutes":
   - <strong>Warm-Up (6 minutes):</strong> Provide an extended warm-up suitable for intensive sessions.
   - <strong>Main Circuit (3 circuits):</strong> Provide 3 circuits, each with 3-4 exercises performed for 45-60 seconds (using rep/set style if applicable), including detailed instructions and, after each exercise, a new line with <strong>Primary muscles worked:</strong> detailing the specific muscles.
   - <strong>Rest &amp; Cool-Down:</strong> Recommend 1-2 minute rest periods (with suggestions like foam rolling or controlled breathing) after each circuit, followed by a 6-minute cool-down.
   - End with a motivational and recovery note such as <strong>Excellent work! Remember, proper recovery is as important as the workout itself.</strong>
