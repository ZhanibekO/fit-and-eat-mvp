Explanation
Backend Files (at the Root):

workout.js & meals.js: Continue handling API calls for dynamic workout and meal plan generation.

wearable.js: A new module that could provide endpoints to connect with wearables or receive data from smart scales. This might include functions for syncing weight data, step counts, heart rate, etc.

server.js: Remains responsible for serving your API endpoints as well as the compiled front‑end. Update its static assets path to point to your build output.

Static Files (public):

index.html: Stays as the minimalist static HTML file that provides an element (like <div id="root"></div>) where your SPA is mounted.

Dynamic Files (src):

components/:

UI Components:

Header.js: Navigation header that might include links to Home, Workouts, Exercises, Profile, etc.

SearchBar.js & FiltersSidebar.js: Reusable components for filtering content on your pages.

ProgressDashboard.js: Specifically designed to show key metrics, charts, or progress photos—this component will be part of the Profile page’s top area.

pages/:

Workouts.js & Exercises.js: Display content related to workouts and exercise databases respectively.

Profile.js: This page could initially load showing the progress dashboard (your personal fitness metrics), and on the left side include a menu for editing account details (like email, password, and profile picture), plus quick links to view current workout challenges, meal plans, or even additional features like device integrations.

App.js: Sets up client‑side routing and combines the header (and other global components) with your various pages.

index.js: Acts as the entry point that mounts your App component into your public/index.html’s designated “root” div.

Global Styling (style.css):

Can either remain at the root (and linked in index.html) or be imported into your src/index.js, ensuring styles apply throughout your app.
